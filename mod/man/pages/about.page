===============================================
ReBasic is a simple, web-based, 8-bit-inspired
BASIC language environment. It resurrects
the idea of interactive and iterative
programming without any IDE or build-run cycle.

Use a web console to build your program
line by line, just line on an old Apple II,
Commodore 64 or ZX Spectrum.

Many examples from old BASIC books should
work with little to no changes.
But be cognizant about PEEK and POKE magic,
since it is machine-dependent.
Replace them with appropriate ReBasic commands.
