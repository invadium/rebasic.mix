=== DIM/ARRAYS ===

Arrays are a way to group and acess data
in a uniform linear way.

Say, you want to read a sequence of numbers.
Instead of declaring a separate variable
for each, you could say:

10 dim arr(10)
20 print "enter values:"
30 for i = 1 to 10
40   input "#";i, arr(i)
50 next i
60 print arr

We declare an array of 10 elements
and read the values one-by-one
from the user in a loop.
