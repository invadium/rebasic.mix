=========  DIM/ARRAYS  =========

Arrays are a way to group and access data
in a uniform linear way.

Say, you want to read a sequence of numbers.
Instead of declaring a separate variable
for each, you could say:

10 dim arr(10)
20 print "enter 10 numbers:"
30 for i = 1 to 10
35   print "#";i;":";
40   input arr(i)
50 next i
60 print "your numbers:"
70 for i = 1 to 10
80 print arr(i);" ";
90 next i
100 print ""

We declare an array of 10 elements and read
the values one by one in a loop.

Then we loop over the array and print out
entered values in a single line.
