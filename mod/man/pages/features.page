=========  FEATURES OVERVIEW  =========
ReBasic is shipped with a lot of fascinating
and sometimes unique features.

* 8-bit Spirit
--------------
We try to preserve compatibility with
8-bit BASIC dialects whenever possible,
but also provide some exclusive capabilities
where they seem fit.

You could expect a pleasant mix of
a genuine retro-styled user interface and
early microcomputers' simplicity, all wrapped up
in a web of modern technologies.

* Line-driven
-------------
Lines are a fundamental part of classic BASIC.
And even though all modern BASIC dialects
abandoned line numbering, we consider it
to be an invaluable learning tool that directly
illustrates how both the machine and
an abstract algorithm work.

* Dynamically-typed
-------------------
ReBasic is dynamically-typed, meaning that
variables can hold values of any type.
Only in rare cases, variable suffixes like [$
can be used to hint the expected type, e.g.:

INPUT S$
INPUT N

ReBasic will read the input into
the [S$] variable as a string and will try
to parse the input into [N] as
a floating point number.

* Separated text buffer and multiple framebuffers
-------------------------------------------------
The text and graphics are rendered into different
layers and don't mix.
Text is always on top (although you can draw text
on the graphics plane as well).

Moreover, there are multiple framebuffers for
graphics that you can use with [SCREEN] command.
You can have text and multiple semi-transparent
graphical layers on the screen at the same time.

* Missing Features
------------------
Some features are obviously missing and we will
try to introduce them in the future releases.

  - no sound support
  - no sprite engine
  - no true procedures with formal parameters
    and local variables
  - no desktop version or PWA
