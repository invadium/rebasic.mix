==================  GRAPHICS  ==================
Graphics is the most unique aspect
of ReBasic. Classic BASIC didn't define
any drawing routines and each 8-bit machine
implemented it's own unique set of commands.

Computers like C64 and VIC-20 didn't have
any dedicated routines and all drawing
was done by direct memory manipulation
with POKE.
Many had a PLOT routine to draw a pixel
and ReBasic starts with that and implements
a set of convenient drawing routines.
Where possible, it follows conventions
defined by ZX Spectrum, MSX and Quick BASIC.
But sometimes it defines its own unique
commands.

For some commands, ReBasic defines aliases
to be compatible with a wider range
of BASIC dialects, e.g. there are
multiple ways to define the background
color:

paper 17
background 17

You can use any interchangeably.

To list all graphics commands,
use [#draw] tag:

help draw

At the moment, the ReBasic graphics system
is very simple - there are only
a few drawing calls and not much
of the draw context customization.
You can't set line width, can't set custom
fonts, can't clip and transform coordinates...

But the basics are there, and it is entirely
possible to adapt graphics examples from
the classic BASIC books.

There are also some advanced capabilities -
you can select different graphics modes with
[MODE #] command and manipulate framebuffers
with the [SCREEN] command.

For example, select the [320x200] mode
with [MODE 5].
[SCREEN #] selects the current framebuffer.
You can draw and switch between framebuffers
to do double buffering and other effects.

Also, it is possible to show multiple
framebuffers at once by enabling them:

SCREEN 2, "ENABLE"
SCREEN 3, "ENABLE"

By keeping the top screens partially transparent,
you can achieve a multi-layered effect
(e.g. use the top layer for HUD).
