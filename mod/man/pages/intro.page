Welcome to reBASIC - a reincarnation of a classic
8-bit era BASIC in a modern web shell.

Experience a long-forgotten programming model,
where you directly interact with the machine.
Forget about Integrated Development Environments,
build systems, package managers, frameworks
and other modern software nonsense.

The programming doesn't have to be complex.

Just open reBASIC shell, go full screen and enjoy
the vibes of 80s programming.
A time when developers controlled machines
and not vice versa.
