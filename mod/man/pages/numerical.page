===============  NUMERICAL  ===============
Use [HELP MATH] or even [HELP "#MATH"]
to list all math-related functions.

Functions must be used in expressions
usually on the right side of
the assignment operator:

10 let speed = 20
20 let a = 3.1415 / 2
30 let dx = cos(a) * speed
40 let dy = sin(a) * speed
50 print dx;":";dy
60 print atn2(dy, dx)


Here, we calculate an angle to be half PI,
then calculate [dx] and [dy] shifts
for the specified speed and angle.

The last line calculates the angle
based on the provided [dx] and [dy],
which should be the same as [a].

Most math operations exactly match their
8-bit counterparts from the old BASIC
books.
