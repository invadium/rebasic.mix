=====  PROFILES  =====
A profile defines the default environment.
Typically, it is ink, paper, and border colors,
but there could be other settings, like
the mouse cursor visibility.

The [PROFILE] command shows the current profile
and lists all available profiles.
Initially, it shows something like [+ DEFAULT].

Say, it is late in the evening, and you don't
want a light profile to disturb your eyes,
select a dark profile with [PROFILE "DARK"],
or maybe [PROFILE "SELENITE"], which goes well
in a low-light environment.
The previous text ink is preserved,
so clear the screen with [CLS] or just replace
the text buffer with new output by running
something like [HELP].

-----  CUSTOM PROFILES  -----
Maybe available color schemas are not enough
and you need a custom one.

Just create a [NEW] program and setup
the environment like so:

10 BORDER 70
20 PAPER 86
30 INK 105
40 OPT("MOUSE") = "HIDE"


First, we set the border, paper, and ink colors
and then hide the mouse cursor.

Run the program to validate the effect.
If everything is fine, save a new profile with
[PROFILE "MY-OWN-PROFILE", "SAVE"].
Then, select the create profile with
[PROFILE "MY-OWN-PROFILE"].
It will be saved in the local browser cache.

Next time you'll load ReBasic, it should
activate your personal profile.
