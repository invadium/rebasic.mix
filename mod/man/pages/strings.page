 ================  STRINGS  ================
You can list the string manipulation
function by running [HELP STRING].

Most of them follow the classic 8-bit BASIC
conventions and compatible with examples
you can find in the old BASIC books.

Functions returning strings are usually
prefixed by [$], e.g.:

* LEFT$()
* MID$()
* RIGHT$()

While functions returning numbers don't:

* LEN()
