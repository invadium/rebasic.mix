============  USEFUL TIPS  ============

* Use Line Numbers(Or Not)
--------------------------
The ReBasic interpreter does not strictly
require line numbers. However, we feel that
they are an integral part of the 8-bit micro
subculture and also allow easy program editing
when in interactive mode.

When loading a program from a file
(by the [LOAD] command), You can easily skip
line numbers and use named labels instead
for commands like GOTO and GOSUB.

* Empty number deletes the line
-------------------------------
To delete a particular line from the program,
enter the line number with no commands.
That line will be removed from the listing.

* Scroll up to see the hidden output
------------------------------------
Some commands and programs could print more
than fits the screen. In such a case,
use the [PageUp] and [PageDown] keys
to review the output text buffer.

* Use History
-------------
The command history is a handy tool
in interactive programming.
Use [Up] and [Down] keys to recall, edit
and execute past commands.

It is useful when we want to repeat
a particularly long command without the need
to retype it.

Also useful to fix errors in recently entered
line of program - just rewind to that line
with [UP], use [LEFT], [RIGHT], [DELETE], and
[BACKSPACE] keys to locate and fix the error,
and [ENTER] the line again.

* Use Source Rewind
-------------------
You can also recall any line from the current
program.
Use [CTRL + UP] and [CTRL + DOWN] to recall
and edit program lines.

* Explore ROM
-------------
You can explore many examples supplied in ROM.

Just type [ROM] to list all included examples
with a short description for each.
Pick an example and load it with
the [LOAD "<NAME>"] command.

* Save Your Program
-------------------
You can save your program by running
[SAVE "<NAME>"]. The web browser should save
the [<name>.bas] file with your program listing.

Next time, type [LOAD] to bring the browser
file dialog and pick the saved .bas file
to load it back.

* Get the latest from local storage
-----------------------------------
The ReBasic web shell saves the latest run
program listing in the browser local storage.

If you've closed your ReBasic browser tab
by mistake and forgot to save the program,
just add #latest suffix to the URL
and refresh the page. ReBasic should restore
the latest run listing.
