1. Say Hello
------------
10 PRINT "HELLO, REBASIC"

2. Many Times Hello
-------------------
10 PRINT "HELLO AGAIN"
20 GOTO 10

It ends up in an endless loop.
Press [ESC] or [CTRL+C]
or [CTRL+BACKSPACE] to interrupt.

3. Slow Hello
-------------
Introduce a delay between iterations,
so you could observe the effect of each line
in real time:

10 LET I = 1
20 PRINT I;". SLOW HELLO"
30 SLEEP 0.5
40 I = I + 1
50 GOTO 20


Here, you could see an introduction
of a variable [I] we are going to use to count
iterations and a more complex form of
the [PRINT] output.
