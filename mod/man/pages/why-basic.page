                  WHY BASIC?
===============================================
ReBasic recreates 8-bit BASIC simplicity
and approachability on the modern web.

Modern languages are too powerful to serve
as an introduction to programming.
They can accomplish amazing things, but
demand a broad background from the users.
You need to understand object-oriented
or functional programming concepts,
Integrated Development Environments,
build tools and pipelines, dependency managers,
clouds and deployment strategies...
A lot of setup and boilerplate is usually
required to build the simplest thing.
They simplify the construction of
auto-scalable services in the cloud
available for millions of users,
but accidentally make basic things hard.

Maybe it is possible to learn to fly using
a 400-ton jumbo jet, but one might consider
simpler options first.

ReBasic tries to be a simpler option.
Many generations of programmers started
with simple 8-bit era environments
running mostly BASIC dialects.

ReBasic replicates the 8-bit feel, the syntax,
the interactivity, the features,
and the line numbers.
